Tesla Grok Integration 

This project is a proof-of-concept for integrating xAI's Grok AI into a Tesla-like infotainment system, enabling voice-driven AI interaction on embedded Linux hardware. It’s a work-in-progress showcasing potential for automotive AI applications.
What It Does

Converts voice commands (supports Greek) to text.
Queries xAI’s Grok API via HTTPS.
Displays AI responses.
Runs lightweight Python code on embedded systems (e.g., Raspberry Pi).
Supports Docker for testing.

Purpose

Demonstrates AI voice integration for automotive infotainment.
Highlights skills in embedded systems, IoT, and AI for automotive use cases.
Serves as a starting point for further development.

Future Improvements

Integrate with Tesla’s native voice system.
Enable WebSocket for real-time communication.
Add text-to-speech for audio responses.
Optimize latency and resource usage for embedded hardware.

Notes
This is an early demo requiring further refinement for production use. Feedback and contributions are welcome to enhance functionality and reliability.
