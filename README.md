Tesla Grok Integration
This project integrates xAI's Grok AI into a Tesla-like infotainment system for voice-driven interaction on embedded Linux hardware.

What It Does
Converts voice commands (supports Greek) to text.
Queries xAI’s Grok API over HTTPS.
Displays AI responses.
Runs lightweight Python code for embedded systems (e.g., Raspberry Pi).
Supports Docker for testing.
Why It Exists
Enables AI-powered voice control in automotive infotainment.
Optimized for low-resource hardware.
Showcases embedded systems, IoT, and AI integration skills for automotive applications.
Future Improvements
Integrate with Tesla’s native voice system.
Use WebSocket for faster communication.
Add text-to-speech for audio responses.
Reduce latency for embedded environments.
